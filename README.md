## Description
This repository is where I was able to use everything I have learned so far to check out an existing code and refactor it. I had to be careful because my job was to improve this code without changing what it does. The code had a few things that I was able to improve on. I looked at the code knowing that my main objectives were to ensure it had semantic HTML elemnts, followed a logical structure, ensure there were accessible alt attributes, and everything fell into a nice sequential order.

## Changes-Made
For the most part I made changes on the HTML first, changing a lot of the "div" tags into tags more appropriate like "head, nav, section, footer, aside, and article." Spaced out some of the sections in the code to clean it up and make it easier to look through. I finally added the alt attribute to the images to ensure people with disabilities can access a website. For the CSS I gathered many similar tags that asked for the same attributes and condensed them, making it easier to control without typing it all out again and making it cleaner. Finally I added a properly commented to css file in order for anyone who looks at it after me to show them what I condensed together. I did this project in order to show how important looking over and refactoring code is.
