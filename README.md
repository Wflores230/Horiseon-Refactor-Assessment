# Horiseon-Refactor-Assessment
This repository is where I was able to use everything I have learned so far to check out an existing code and refactor it . I had to be careful because my job was to improve this code without changing what it does. The code had a few things that I was able to improve on. I looked at the code knowing that my main objectives were to ensure it had semantic HTML elemnts, followed a logical structure, ensure there were accessible alt attributes, and everything fell into a nice sequential order.
